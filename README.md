# 📸 Image Captioning using VGG16 and LSTM

This project demonstrates an end-to-end deep learning model for automatically generating captions for images. The system combines **VGG16**, a Convolutional Neural Network for image feature extraction, and **LSTM**, a Recurrent Neural Network for generating meaningful captions in natural language.

## 🧠 Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to create a deep learning model that can interpret an image and generate a descriptive caption. This project also aims to:
- Bridge the gap between Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.
- Assist visually impaired individuals by converting visual data into speech.
- Evaluate model performance using BLEU score metrics.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Libraries

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras  
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, NLTK, PIL  
- **Model Used**: VGG16 (pre-trained on ImageNet), LSTM  
- **Dataset**: [Flickr8K Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k)

---

## 🧩 Model Architecture

- **VGG16** is used to extract visual features from the input image.
- The output feature vector is passed to an **LSTM** network, which is trained to predict the next word in the caption sequence.
- Captions are tokenized and padded to a fixed length.  
- The model learns to generate captions word-by-word using image features and previously predicted words.

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-captioning-vgg16-lstm.git
cd image-captioning-vgg16-lstm
````

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Prepare the dataset**

* Download the Flickr8K dataset and place images inside `flickr8k/Images/`.
* Make sure `captions.txt` is in the root folder.

4. **Run the notebook**
   Open and run `Image_Captioning.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

## 📊 Evaluation

* **BLEU Score** is used to measure the quality of generated captions.
* The model achieves a BLEU score of approximately **0.57** on the test set.
* Sample results show generated captions are contextually relevant and syntactically correct.

---

## 🔊 Additional Features

* [ ] Voice output for generated captions using text-to-speech (TTS).
* [ ] Multilingual caption generation (Coming Soon).
* [ ] Web app interface (using Streamlit or Flask).

## 🌟 Sample Output

| Image                                  | Generated Caption                      |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| ![sample1](flickr8k/Images/123456.jpg) | "A dog is running through a field"     |
| ![sample2](flickr8k/Images/234567.jpg) | "Two children are playing in the park" |

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

* Upgrade to Transformer-based models (e.g., ViT + GPT).
* Train on larger datasets like **MS COCO** for better generalization.
* Deploy the model as an API or web app with real-time image upload and voice feedback.
